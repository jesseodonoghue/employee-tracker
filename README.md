# Employee Tracker
This app required me to create a node.js app that stores, displays, and deletes employees, roles, and departments to a mySql database. 

## App Breakdown
This program is a node.js app written in JavaScript and uses a mySql database for data storage. Upon launch, the user is asked which task they'd like to perform:

Each category has it's own options for tasks:

Once each task has been fulfilled successfully, the user is presented with a success message:
